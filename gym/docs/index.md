##BMI calculator


BMI stands for Body Mass Index, which is a measure of body fat based on a person's height and weight. It is calculated by dividing a person's weight in kilograms by their height in meters squared.

The formula for BMI is:
BMI = weight (kg) / height^2 (m^2)

BMI

Underweight: BMI less than 18.5
Normal weight: BMI between 18.5 and 24.9
Overweight: BMI between 25 and 29.9
Obesity: BMI 30 or higher
It's important to note that while BMI can be a useful tool for assessing general health risks, it is not a perfect measure and does not take into account factors such as muscle mass, bone density, or body composition. Therefore, it's important to use BMI in conjunction with other measures of health, such as blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and waist circumference. Additionally, it's always a good idea to consult with a healthcare professional for personalized advice and guidance on maintaining a healthy weight and lifestyle.



## Meal Plan and Calories

When creating a meal plan, it's important to consider your daily calorie needs. Calories are a measure of the energy that food provides to your body, and your calorie needs can vary depending on factors such as age, gender, weight, height, and physical activity level.

To determine your daily calorie needs, you can use a calorie calculator or consult with a healthcare professional. Once you know how many calories you need each day, you can plan your meals and snacks accordingly.
